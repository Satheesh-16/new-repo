// Future home of stable Ember types! This file currently does nothing, but in
// the months ahead will look more and more like the `/types/preview/index.d.ts`
// while that one empties. This is just here so that someone who writes the
// import we recommend--
//
// ```ts
// import 'ember-source/types';
// import 'ember-source/types/preview';
// ```
//
// --will not get warnings from TypeScript while we wait on putting actual
// things here!
